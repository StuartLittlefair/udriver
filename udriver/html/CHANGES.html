<p>
This file records changes to the Udriver Java client to drive
ULTRACAM.

<tr valign="top"><td><strong>
10/05/07
</strong></td><td><i>
Several<br>
<font color="red">Version 2.1.0</font>
</i></td><td>
Changes to include the new u-band co-add parameter NBLUE. 
Not tested however.
</td></tr>

<tr valign="top"><td><strong>
17/11/06
</strong></td><td><i>
Several<br>
<font color="red">Version 2.0.2</font>
</i></td><td>
A fair few changes, mainly in the way the software is set up.
Some minor bugs ironed out of the IntegerTextField class.
</td></tr>

<tr valign="top"><td><strong>
04/03/06
</strong></td><td><i>
Udriver.java<br>
<font color="red">Version 2.0.1</font>
</i></td><td>
Minor bug that made it report an incorrect exposure time in 2 windows
plus clear mode.
</td></tr>

<tr valign="top"><td><strong>
02/09/05
</strong></td><td><i>
Udriver.java<br>
<font color="red">Version 2.0.0</font>
</i></td><td>
Following the August run, where on several occasions we forgot to put
the mask in or out, I have added an option which will prompt the user
to remember the mask when one switches between standard and drift
mode. I have also made some fairly major changes to allow for
different telescopes better than I did before. One will now not need
for example to change the configuration file when switching
telescopes. The software is also rather cleaner in this area. Adding a
new telescope now essentially requires adding some data at the top
of Udriver.java. These changes are sufficiently extensive to warrant a
major version change. Keep your old version available!
</td></tr>

<tr valign="top"><td><strong>
14/05/05
</strong></td><td><i>
Udriver.java<br>
<font color="red">Version 1.6</font>
</i></td><td>
Fixed bug whereby it was setting the 'ULTRACAM servers on' flag to the
value of 'Expert mode'
</td></tr>

<tr valign="top"><td><strong>
13/05/05
</strong></td><td><i>
Udriver.java<br>
<font color="red">Version 1.5</font>
</i></td><td>
Window synchronisation added. This moves the windows onto a standard
phasing when binning.
</td></tr>

<tr valign="top"><td><strong>
05/05/05
</strong></td><td><i>
Udriver.java<br>
<font color="red">Version 1.4</font>
</i></td><td>
simple reset of PCI no longer disables post application; removed
'reset' from noddy mode. 'request from rtplot' message now only
reported in DEBUG mode.
</td></tr>

<tr valign="top"><td><strong>
05/05/05
</strong></td><td><i>
Udriver.java<br>
<font color="red">Version 1.3</font>
</i></td><td>
fixed bug in that it was not updating the format 
so repeatedly prompted for estimating the number of bytes per image.
</td></tr>

<tr valign="top"><td><strong>
04/05/05
</strong></td><td><i>
Udriver.java<br>
<font color="red">Version 1.2</font>
</i></td><td>
fixed bug in estimating the number of bytes per image.
</td></tr>

<tr valign="top"><td><strong>
04/05/05
</strong></td><td><i>
Udriver.java
</i></td><td>
Made the value of the small exposure time entry = 5 on start up. Made
reply from servers stay for any one command so that multiple commands
such as the combined initialisation task give a complete record of
what happened.
</td></tr>

<tr valign="top"><td><strong>
25/04/05
</strong></td><td><i>
Udriver.java<br>
<font color="red">Version 1.1</font>
</i></td><td>
More safety features added. These are (1) the settings buttons
are disabled if you use a given setup for a run but have not saved
it to disk, (2) you will be prompted for confirmation when you try to overwrite an
existing application file. This is to reduce the chances of wiping out
earlier setups. Restriction (1) is lifted in 'Expert' mode.
</td></tr>

<tr valign="top"><td><strong>
30/03/05
</strong></td><td><i>
Udriver.java<br>
<font color="red">Version 1.0</font>
</i></td><td>
Added signal-to-noise for 1 exposure field
</td></tr>

<tr valign="top"><td><strong>
24/03/05
</strong></td><td><i>
IntegerTextField.java<br>
DoubleTextField.java
</i></td><td>
Found that automatic increment could get into infinite loop, now fixed
</td></tr>

<tr valign="top"><td><strong>
23/03/05
</strong></td><td><i>
Udriver.java<br>
<font color="red">Version 0.6</font>
</i></td><td>
Lots more debugging. Added code to try to get run number; disabled settings
option to define state of ULTRACAM servers during a run;
added 'Timing test' application; brought numbers I use for
signal-to-noise into line with Vik's; changed selection of sky
brightness to radio button form; made colours of disk space monitor
change as one approaches 2GB: 1500 MB changes to orange, 1800 changes
to red; fixed a problem with the paste operation being re-enabled in
numeric fields; added many more items of information to the 'Timing
details' information message. First fully-featured version I think.
</td></tr>

<tr valign="top"><td><strong>
22/03/05
</strong></td><td><i>
Udriver.java<br>
<font color="red">Version 0.5</font>
</i></td><td>
'Start run' now only enabled after one has posted an
application. 'Setup servers' greys out once you have done it.
Changed polling interval for checking on active run; now it should
be looking for correct part of XML I hope. Fixed exposure time bug.
Put in checks for OK response from server. Put in noddy mode
'Initialise' and 'Reset' buttons, with full complement appearing if
one switches to expert. Added 'DEBUG' switch inside the configuration
file. Once things have settled, it can be switched off.
</td></tr>

<tr valign="top"><td><strong>
22/03/05
</strong></td><td><i>
Udriver.java<br>
<font color="red">Version 0.4</font>
</i></td><td>
Added option of defining 0.1 millisecond increments on exposure
delay. Enabled in expert mode only. Removed 'pipe shift' from 
standard timing information as potentially confusing; still available
from detailed timing pop-up. Changed floating point input to resemble
the integer input. Put check for status of data server, but need Stu
to check this.
</td></tr>

<tr valign="top"><td><strong>
21/03/05
</strong></td><td><i>
Udriver.java<br>
DoubleTextField.java
</i></td><td>
Improved input of floating point numbers such as magnitude so that
they are pretty similar in fell to the integer input.
</td></tr>

<tr valign="top"><td><strong>
18/03/05
</strong></td><td><i>
Udriver.java<br>
udriver.conf<br>
<font color="red">Version 0.2</font>
</i></td><td>
Fixed bug picked up by Stu in the execCommand method 
which was sending the wrong string. Put /ultracam/config/xml as
default directory for templates on server
</td></tr>
