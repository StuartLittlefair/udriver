To set up this software, you must have 'java' and 'jar' in your path.
This has been tested with 1.6; not known if it works with 1.5 or below,
but it might do; it would have to be at least 1.4 in any case.

To install:
===========

MySQL support
-------------

After Richard Hickman's upgrades of December 2009, udriver now has 
(optional) access to a database of targets we have built from past 
ULTRACAM runs. If you want to access this you need to install software 
to connect to mysql. This is optional; if you don't have it, target 
name lookups will not access the ULTRACAM database, but will be able 
to access SIMBAD (assuming the network is alive that is). The officially 
supported java/mysql link can be found at:

http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/

All you need do is download the tar file, 'tar xvfz' it and put the file
'mysql-connector-java-5.1.10-bin.jar' (version number may change) somewhere
sensible. You need then to define an environment variable 'UDRIVERPATH' in
order for udriver to pick it up as in (C-shell):

setenv UDRIVERPATH $HOME/Java/mysql-connector-java-5.1.10-bin.jar

and you are done

The standard installation
-------------------------

After you have (or have not, you can do it later if you want) 
installed the MySQL support then the installation is as before:

cd src

First look at the file 'Makefile'. The one line you may wish to alter is

INSTALL_DIR         = $(HOME)/software/udriver-$(VERSION)

which defines where the directory where software will be installed.

Edit it as you wish. Then:

touch udriver.conf
gmake install

and that's it.


To run:
-------

Then type

<installation directory>/bin/udriver

to run the software. You may wish to set up an alias
as in

alias udriver <installation directory>/bin/udriver

For further information, look at 
http://deneb.astro.warwick.ac.uk/phsaap/ultracam/udriver/index.html
or if you have installed everything OK, you should also have a local version
called file:<installation directory>/html/index.html

Let me know of any problems,
