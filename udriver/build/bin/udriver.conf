# Configuration file for Java program UDriver for driving and configuring ULTRACAM.
# I hope that it should not normally be necessary to edit this. Use a semi-colon
# ';' to separate multiple components. All items with yes / no answers should
# be either exactly  yes, no, true or false, (case-insensitive).

#
#  Things that you may often want to change
# 
# ===========================================
#
# RTPLOT_SERVER_ON      = Whether to switch the rtplot server on or not
#                         [YES/NO]. You may well want to use this while observing,
#                         probably not otherwise.
#
# ULTRACAM_SERVERS_ON   = This controls enabling of all actions to do with the
#                         servers. It does no harm to leave it on, but prevents
#                         you from even trying to interact with the servers.
#
# EXPERT_MODE           = If yes, all actions are always enabled allowing you to
#                         do anything, including screwing up. If off the program
#                         tries to be clever and not allow you to do things it
#                         thinks are wrong.
#
# FILE_LOGGING_ON       = if yes, then (most) items printed in the
#                         left-hand short-format window are also sent
#                         to a file. They are appended if the file
#                         already exists. The file is written as an html table
#                         with times and could be useful information to retain 
#                         after a run. Some error messages sent to the window
#                         may not be saved if they are of no interest except at 
#                         the time of running.

#  Things you may occasionally want to change

# ==============================================
#
# HTTP_CAMERA_SERVER    = The URL of ULTRACAM camera server. The port number is
#                         unlikely to change but the rest of the URL could
#                         depending whether you run on the rack PC (localhost)
#                         or not.
#
# HTTP_DATA_SERVER      = URL of ULTRACAM data server. See comment on the camera
#                         server
#
# APP_DIRECTORY         = Initial directory on local machine to save applications
#                         to and load applications from.
#
# XML_TREE_VIEW         = View XML responses from server in tree form or not. [YES/NO]
#
# TEMPLATE_FROM_SERVER  = Get template from the server, else they will be taken
#                         from TEMPLATE_DIRECTORY. Taking them from the server
#                         is perhaps more "from the horse's mouth", but it
#                         requires the server to be working of course. This
#                         only applied to the applications which define the
#                         windows and is simply to allow one to work without
#                         the server running. Normally it should be on.
#
# TEMPLATE_DIRECTORY    = Location of the template files, if they are to be taken from
#                         local machine rather than the server.
#
# LOG_FILE_DIRECTORY    = default directory for log files
#
# CONFIRM_ON_CHANGE     = yes to prompt a confirmation of the target name after
#                         any change of setup without a corresponding change of
#                         target. This is a safety device.
#
# OBSERVING_MODE        = if 'no', this switches off everything to do
#                         with observing.
#
# TELESCOPE             = This is needed for giving information on
#                         peak counts and field size. At present
#                         VLT and WHT are supported values (case
#                         sensitive)
#
# DEBUG                 = this enables more reporting of errors
